          <p>Hello to the person visiting my website, my name is Hayden Lay and my student number is s3897249 and my student email address is s3897249@student.rmit.edu.au. I was born in Australia, Darwin, however, my background and culture is Timorese where I usually speak Chinese Hakka at home. One fact about me is that I built and have a $2000 gaming pc that I barely use to play games on. Some of my hobbies are playing soccer, watching and reading anime, going to the gym, and playing video games. Additionally, I enjoy meeting new people and making new friends as I intend to experience this through RMIT as I believe I will meet wonderful people there.</p>
