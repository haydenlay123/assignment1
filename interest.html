          <h1 class="page-title">My interest in IT</h1>
          <h4>Why am I interest in IT?</h4>
          <p>As Technology is constantly changing in our society, I want to be a part of that change and attempt to make a positive difference in our world through Information Technology. My interest in IT was sparked around the age of 15 or 16 as I met and talked to someone who worked in the IT field. This allowed me to watch and experience how IT affects our world and how demanding is in our society, as well as the amount of money you get paid working in IT-related fields. From this, that began my journey into wanting to experience and work in the IT field.
            <h4>What experiences do I have in IT?</h4>
          <p>The understanding that I have in IT is that I was able to assemble 2 gaming pcs which required me to understand how the computers work externally and internally, as well as understanding each component and their names when I was assembling my gaming rig. Another experience that I have is that I went to TAFE to do a 2-year course in Computer Assembly and Repair starting 2018 and finishing 2020, where I was able to experience and work on operating systems like Linux and Raspberry Pi OS, assembling and disassembling computers, working with networks, etc.</p>
          <h4>Why did I chose RMIT and what do i expect to learn during my studies?</h4>
          <p>I chose to study at RMIT because of its good IT program and the positive feedback and recommendations from past students. During my studies, I expect to improve my current skills and knowledge surrounding IT, so I can tackle new problems and work on new ideas in the future, and experience and learn new things that may come in handy when working on things that are IT related.</p>
