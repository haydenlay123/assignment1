          <h1 class="page-title">Project Idea</h1>
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>My project will be based on developing a smartphone app, specifically a parking app, by using python to bring my app alive. As the number of individuals with smartphones keep growing constantly every day, it is a perfect idea for me to hope on the smartphone app industry and create an app where many individuals will appreciate and constantly use. As there are not many parking apps around, I believe my parking app will fit our current society where individuals will find this app as a necessity in their daily lifestyle when driving to a busy place, such as the shops or the city.</p>
          <h3>Motivation</h3>
          <p>My motivation for designing a smartphone app, specifically a parking app is that when I go to busy parking spaces and see many drivers aimlessly around in search of a single parking spot, it gave me the discomfort and uneasiness learning from that a filled-up parking space could make any driver stressed and unhappy, due to it being the long duration of searching a car park. Furthermore, I did not want to suffer the same fate as the many drivers I saw in my experience and as I am close to getting Ps, I would not want to be in the same position and go hours in search of a single parking space. Statistics based on the ABC News, “On average, motor vehicles are parked 95 per cent of the time”, this is worrying news as this could mean the difficulty of finding parking space will increase causing disruptions for drivers and my future self.</p>
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>As my passion is always searching for easier solutions for any obstacles that arise in my life, I wanted to make an app where many individuals can experience the easiness of searching for a parking spot. My parking app, being able to be downloaded in IOS and Android, will allow users to use this app in real-time, meaning that they will be able to keep track of any open parking space that may arise without any delays, for example finding available parking in the city or shops with details like parking hours and meter fees, being able to plan by having this app tell you how many parking spaces there are before arriving at your destination, and with the in-built navigation system, this will allow users to use it as a GPS and follow the apps directions to their open parking spot. With these features, I believe users will have a better time finding a parking spot the next time when they go out to a busy area. Another handy feature for users is that parking spaces in the city usually consists of a parking meter for a user to pay, the user can feed the meter online either before parking or when completely parked, meaning that no time is wasted and allow the users to keep going on their day without any obstacles. Moreover, users who are planning their day will be able to set the time limit they will be staying at their parking spot or compare prices to other spots in the area where the user wants to park, intending that users will be able to reserve that parking spot before going out (2-day limit), meaning that they will have to pay the app to make that time limit and reservation, however, their minds will be at ease as they will not have to go through the struggles in searching a parking spot on the day. From this, users will be able to use a detailed history of their parking expenses and parking destinations from the app, allowing users to save money and choose better parking spots next time when going out. Furthermore, this being an important app for and many other driver app users, new users will be presented with a discount on their first time downloading this app making it $5 a month, to keep this app running and adding more new features and designs in the future. However, this app is not only solely for paid users but free app users as well, as they will get a trial run for a month of the app and can decide whether this app is for them or not. Additionally, there is a membership for users who pays $20 a month for this app where they can have access to premium features such as being able to test new features and user interface for the app and provide feedback afterwards, have access to other countries parking spaces where they are not struggling to find any parking space outside their country, finding parking space at busy airports, and many more.</P>
          <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
          <p>For me to build my parking app, I will use python to program this app as python is currently growing in popularity due to its compatibility with major platforms and apps, I want to take advantage of this as and ensure every individual can download this app. Furthermore, as I am currently learning programming being python during my time at RMIT, I will gain the necessary skills and knowledge when I finish my 3-year course which will help me build the app without any assistance from professionals which could be costly for me. For hardware, I will need a generally good pc to keep up with the long programming language being implemented, as well as test runs of the app which may use a lot of CPU and RAM. This will mean I might need to invest into specific computer parts for me to ensure the process of building my parking app go smoothly.</p>
          <h3>Skills required</h3>
          <p>The skills I need for this project is my abilities and knowledge of the programming language python as I believe python will have a major impact on the development of this parking app, for example, knowing basic programming and advance programming. Furthermore, I will also invest in my time and develop a new skill into researching apps interface and UI design as appearance can make it attractive and appealing for current users - so they will not get bored of the usual design, and new users into trying my parking app for the first time. This will not be an issue for me developing my python as I will be doing this during my time at RMIT, however, it will be difficult to develop a new skill in UI design and appearance as I will need to be motivated and invest my own time into developing this skill. This project will not require any special hardware but a good computer to run the program which is very easy to obtain.</p>
          <h3>Outcome</h3>
          <p>When this project become successful, I imagine that many drivers will download this app for the first time and experience the easiness and convenience of this app, as they will easily find any parking spot at their destined location. This will mean many users will spread the news of this new app to other drivers which will cause an influx of new users at the beginning of introducing this app, which means that many users will either become a member or give a trial of the parking app. With more drivers using this app, this will also mean more parking space for users to find which will solve the original issue where at the beginning many struggled to find a single car park in a busy area. Overtime as more users grow, car parks will be efficiently used where every driver will be able to find a car park without the struggle of searching one over a long duration of time.</p>
