          <h3>Cyber security Analyst</h3>
          <h4>Description</h4>
          <p>This position requires you to monitor multiple networks, servers, and cloud applications within their enterprise, as well as provide cybersecurity for their business and internal and external to assist in preventing and hunting any hackers that may intrude and steal valuable information. Furthermore, it is also required to do constant assessments and security audit/reviews against Citadel Group internal and external environment, as well as improving and providing innovative cybersecurity activities. This position appeals to me as I find working with networks and servers fascinating by understanding how they work and interconnected with one another, as well as defending against intruders as I enjoy learning anything cybersecurity-related programming by setting up defenses and anti-viruses.</p>
          <h4>Skills I need</h4>
          <p>For this position, you are required to have the ability to analyse information security-related information, events and incidents, have strong knowledge and understanding of networks, cybersecurity concepts, and information systems, able to organise and manage a junior security staff, having a strong verbal and written skills so you can effectively communicate with your peers, and a strong interpersonal skill to have the ability to work with various team members and customers.</p>
          <h4>Skills I have</h4>
          <p>In my current state when writing up my profile, I have little to no experience or knowledge in cybersecurity concepts, information systems which could be problematic when joining a cybersecurity-related career. However, I have a sense of my verbal, written, and interpersonal skills where I can work with an appropriate group, yet I wish to improve these skills so I can have greater confidence and skills when working with a group full of professionals. Furthermore, I have general skill and knowledge when assembling and disassembling computers, as well as running diagnostics to computers with issues, however, I believe it may not be suitable for this current position.</p>
          <h4>Learning plan</h4>
          <p>To obtain these skills required to work in this position, I will need to learn the cybersecurity concepts to help me gain a vast amount of knowledge to help analyse information security-related data, events, and incidents, and provide proper advice to the organisation about protecting their data and their internal and external stakeholders. I believe this can be done by participating in a cybersecurity course during my years at RMIT which could help me gain the knowledge and skills needed to be placed in this position. Furthermore, for skills such as my verbal, written, and interpersonal skills, I can learn and improve these skills by participating in group projects which can improve my written and interpersonal skills, and participating in extracurricular activities at RMIT which can help improve my verbal skills to have the ability to communicate with my peers in a team base scenario.</p>
